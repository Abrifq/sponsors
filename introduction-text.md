Hey, I'm Arda!

# Sorry, who?

I'm a computer nerd who decided the systems weren't going to fix themselves. So I dirtied my hands myself (self-learnt dev)
Currently studying Computer Engineering at Namik Kemal University (Last Update: 2022)(Turkey's Comp. Eng. is somewhat equivalent of Europe's Comp. Sci)

## Hmm, what are you working on?

Since I aim to fix systems, i have a million ideas that can be done. However, here are some of them I invested in so much, they got a name... mostly:

- **ATRAS**, Better, in-house Transifex that is designed with freelancers & clients in mind with features like:
  - Slack/Teams integration
  - self-hosting for company networks
  - a Github Issues like system for discussing context and meanings for each "translateable"
  - and some more TBD.

- **OPTÄ°K**, Github Classroom clone with extra features like:
  - Batch grading (to save costs!)
  - Self-hostable
  - Basic cheat detection
  - Github and Gitlab integration support.
  - Optional verbose fields for each test to inform students on what they did wrong, without having 100+ email conversations.
  - Data, data, data! Manually and systemically exporting data for creating graphs or just automating school gradings.
  - Q&A section, just like [Google's Code Competitions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/). Not every question has to be public but if it is, students can _agree_ to get your attention on a popular question.

- **PDA-Talkie**, An emergency walkie-talkie and station with some PDA-like features, such as:
  - "Complete" isolation of PDA mode and radio mode so you won't have to deal with any developer UI when you need to just communicate, quickly.
  - "Decentralized" as in every PDA's transaction happens either with another PDA or the paired station.
  - On an emergency, people with PDAs can join emergency searches.
  - Optional weather reporting, useful in urban, mountain areas.
  - GPS and Bluetooth to locate your device. Only the paired station and a emergency search attendee will get the location data.
  - Open sourcing the hardware, software code and even the CI/CD process to auto-test the firmware.
  - Hardware designed to be servicable: Assuming no critical PCB damages happened, it should be possible to just replace a component, down to the "module" level. (for ex: replacing the HC-05 bluetooth radio component of the radio module)
  - Obviously, more time will come, more will be designed, more will be dreamt. Some features are still TBD.

## Why is my sponsorship important to you? How will you use the funds?

I will need money to develop both myself and the projects. Hardware development, for example, even with just trial and error on parts and modules, is free until a point.

Also as with other people's needs, I will need to eat, have a check-up and pay bills. For that, I will need _your_ help.

Also by sponsoring me you can commission projects to me (discounts may be done if i like it or agreed to open source it) or bid on new features on existing projects (whether my project or someone else's OSS).

That is important because as a **person**, like **all other people**, I also burnout from projects time to time, so having a project idea that's ready to start is really good.

I also want to give better support to some of my projects as a company, and it is scary to found a company based on no portfolio: So, you will be **a** founding stone laid on the company's base.
